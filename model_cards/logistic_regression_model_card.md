# Model Card for Logistic Regression Model

## Model Details
- **Model Name**: Logistic Regression Classifier
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Type**: Classification
- **Architecture**: Linear classifier with logistic function
- **Random Seed**: 42
- **Framework**: scikit-learn

## Intended Use
This model is designed to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on census data. It can be used for:
- Income prediction in demographic studies
- Economic research
- Policy analysis
- Resource allocation planning

## Training Data
- **Source**: UCI Census Income Dataset
- **Size**: 32,561 samples
- **Features**: 14 input features including age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, etc.
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
  - Standardization for numerical features
  - Label binarization for target variable

## Evaluation Data
- **Source**: Same as training data (split)
- **Size**: 6,513 samples (20% of total data)
- **Split Method**: Random split with seed 42
- **Preprocessing**: Same as training data

## Metrics
- **Precision**: 0.7285
- **Recall**: 0.2699
- **F-beta Score**: 0.3939

## Ethical Considerations
- **Bias**: The model may reflect historical biases present in the training data
- **Privacy**: The model uses demographic data that should be handled with care
- **Transparency**: The model's decisions are based on multiple features, making it important to monitor for fairness

## Caveats and Recommendations
- **Usage Limitations**: 
  - Model should not be used as the sole decision maker for financial decisions
  - Results should be validated against domain expertise
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Model performs better on majority classes
  - May need retraining with updated data
- **Maintenance**:
  - Regular monitoring of model performance
  - Periodic retraining with fresh data
